Weather Forecast Chatbot using Django and OpenAI
This is a Django web application that serves as a weather forecast chatbot. It uses the OpenAI API to generate responses to user queries about the weather. The user can input a location, ask a question, and the chatbot will provide the weather information for that location along with an AI-generated response to the user's question.
rerequisites
Before running this application, make sure you have the following:

# Python installed on your system.
# Django installed. You can install it using pip:

-->pip install django

# An OpenAI API key. You can sign up and obtain an API key from the OpenAI website.

**Setup**
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

Install the required packages using pip:
-->pip install requests

Replace the openai.api_key in views.py with your own OpenAI API key:
-->openai.api_key = "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"

Run the Django development server:
-->python manage.py runserver
**How it Works**
views.py
	* The weather_forecast function handles the main functionality of the application. When the user submits a form with the location and a question, this function is called.

	* The function calls the fetch_weather_data function to get weather information for the specified location using the OpenWeatherMap API.

	*If the weather data is retrieved successfully, it composes a prompt with the weather information and the user's question. Then, it calls the get_gpt_response function to generate an AI response using the ChatGPT API.

	*The function then renders the result.html template with the retrieved weather information, the user's question, and the AI-generated response.

**fetch_weather_data**

	*This function makes a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data for the given location. It parses the response and extracts the temperature, humidity, and weather description.

**get_gpt_response**

	*This function takes a prompt as input and uses the OpenAI API to generate an AI response using the ChatGPT model. It returns the generated text as the response.

**User Interface**
	*The user interface is designed using HTML templates (index.html, result.html) and CSS stylesheets. The user can input a location and a question about the weather, and the application will display the weather information along with the AI-generated response.

**Summary**
	*This Django web application combines weather forecast data from OpenWeatherMap API with AI-generated responses from the OpenAI API to provide users with weather information and answer their questions about the weather for a specific location. It can be further expanded and enhanced with additional features to improve the user experience.
